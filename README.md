## Instructions

1. **Arithmetic Operations**
   - Accepts two numbers and performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and exponential.

2. **Check Armstrong Number**
   - Validates whether a given number is an Armstrong number.

3. **Find Substrings**
   - Takes a user input string and prints all possible substrings.

4. **Divide by Zero Exception**
   - Demonstrates a try-catch block for handling a DivideByZeroException.

5. **Pascal's Triangle**
   - Generates and prints Pascal's Triangle based on the user-specified number of rows.

6. **Floyd's Triangle**
   - Generates and prints Floyd's Triangle based on the user-specified number of rows.

7. **Read File**
   - Reads and displays the content of a text file using different approaches, such as `File.ReadAllText()`, `File.ReadAllLines()`, and `StreamReader`.

8. **Stack Operations**
   - Implements a basic stack with operations like push, pop, peek, and display.

9. **Complex Number Operations**
   - Takes two complex numbers as input, performs addition, and displays the result.

10. **Shapes Drawing and Erasing**
    - Illustrates polymorphism by drawing and erasing various shapes (Circle, Triangle, Square, Rectangle).

11. **Shapes Area and Perimeter**
    - Calculates and displays the area and perimeter of different shapes (Circle, Triangle, Square, Rectangle).

12. **Resize Rectangle**
    - Allows the user to create a rectangle and then resize it by changing its width and height.

## Running the Program

- Execute the `Main()` method in the `Program` class to start the program.
- Choose from the menu options by entering the corresponding number.

## Note

- The program is structured using object-oriented principles, demonstrating the use of classes, interfaces, and inheritance.
- Some functionalities may prompt for user input, so follow the on-screen instructions.
